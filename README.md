# Simply.ml

Simply.ml is a data labelling program which allows technical users to upload datasets to be labelled for machine learning.
These datasets are then given to users which carry out the classification. The aim is to allow companies to harness the power of machine learning, without incurring major costs.

The program is written in python and makes use of the Django web-framework.
